    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Carmel High School Chess Club, founded in 2021 under the leadership of Yash Bhargava, has experienced remarkable
      growth and development.
      Starting from its humble beginnings, the club has steadily expanded its reach and influence to include a diverse
      and enthusiastic community
      of chess enthusiasts. Today, we are proud to announce that the club has found a home at the esteemed Carmel Clay
      Public Library.
      <br>
      <br>
      At CHS Chess Club, we are dedicated to fostering a vibrant chess culture. We organize and host multiple engaging
      meetings each week, providing
      a welcoming environment for chess enthusiasts of all skill levels to come together, learn, and compete. As a
      testament to our commitment, we have
      also had the privilege of organizing Gambit 425, a highly anticipated chess tournament that embraces participants
      of all ages. This prestigious event
      takes place right within the walls of the library, further strengthening our ties with the community.
      <br>
      <br>
      With a passionate and dedicated team, CHS Chess Club continues to make strides in promoting the game of chess and
      creating a vibrant chess community in Carmel.
